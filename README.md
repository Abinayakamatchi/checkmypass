This an very intresting password checker to know how many times your password has been hacked. One can just type in there password and check if it was hacked before and the count will also be displayed.The code is written in python.
As we know there are many companies like facebook,linkedin,yahoo sometimes thier databases get leaked,and our usernames and passwords get leaked.Then hackers use the leaked passwords and try to login ,for that over here we hash the password and then use it.when we type the password it gets hashed and then checks it was hacked.
we can list number of passwords and see how many times it was hacked.
